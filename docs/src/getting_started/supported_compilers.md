# Supported Compilers
## Requesting Support
If you do not see your compiler in the following list and would like support
added, feel free to make an issue at the repository's
[issue page](https://github.com/Matthewacon/CX/issues) with the tag
`Feature Request`.

Better yet, if you would like to implement support for a new compiler
make an issue at the [issue page](https://github.com/Matthewacon/CX/issues)
with the `Feature Request` tag and leave a comment noting that you
are self-assigning the issue. When you're all ready to make your PR, be
sure to reference the issue in question so reviewers know what your PR
is for!

## List of Supported Compilers
| | |
| :- | :- |
| ðŸŸ¢ | Fully supported |
| ðŸ”µ | Minor discrepancies; all features functional with minor issues |
| ðŸŸ£ | Moderate discrepancies; most features functional, some with potentially non-standard behaviour |
| ðŸŸ  | Major discrepancies; many features non-functional or unimplemented |
| ðŸ”´ | Not supported yet |

| Status | Compiler | Versions |
| :- | :- | :- |
| ðŸ”µ | `Clang` | **10.x.x+**+ |
| ðŸ”µ | `AppleClang` | **???** |
| ðŸ”µ | `Intel LLVM` | **???** |
| ðŸŸ  | `GCC` | **10.x.x** - **12.x.x** |
| ðŸ”´ | `MSVC` | **???** |

## Known Issues
### GCC
ðŸŸ  **10.2.x**
<table id="numbered-description-table">
 <tr><td>

  There is a known bug that rejects valid code when invoking
  variadic concepts without any arguemnts,
  [see here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=98717).

  **Note**: *This bug is fixed in GCC *10.3.x*+.*

  ---
  This does not immediately impact any CX facilities, however, you may
  experience compiler errors on valid code when using purely
  variadic concepts without arguments.

 </td></tr>

ðŸŸ  **10.x.x** - **12.x.x**
<table id="numbered-description-table">
 <tr><td>

  There is an arbitrary limit on the complexity of constraints as
  represented internally by the GCC equation solver,
  [see here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100828).

  **Note**: *The bug report contains a patch that removes the
  constraint complexity limit. After applying the patch, GCC
  compiles CX with no issues. The patch should work on GCC
  **11.x.x**+.*

  **Affected Constructs**:

  $$
   \begin{CD}
    \overbrace{\text{CX::FunctionWithPrototype}}^{\text{<cx/idioms.h>}} @<<depends<
    \begin{cases}
     \begin{CD}
      \overbrace{\text{CX::Lambda}}^{\text{<cx/lambda.h>}}
       @<<depends<
      \overbrace{\text{CX::Defer}}^{\text{<cx/memory.h>}}
      &\\
      \underbrace{\text{CX::AllocLambda}}_{\text{<cx/lambda.h>}}
       @<<depends<
      \underbrace{\text{CX::AllocDefer}}_{\text{<cx/memory.h>}}
     \end{CD}\\
    \end{cases}
   \end{CD}
  $$

  All affected constructs are unusable as this compiler bug rejects
  valid code.
